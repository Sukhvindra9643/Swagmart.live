        <p>Welcome to our refund policy page. We understand that sometimes things may not go as planned, and you may need to return a product or service. Therefore, we have put in place a refund policy that protects you and ensures a fair resolution to any issues you may encounter.</p>
      <div>
        <h3>Products</h3>
        <p>
          If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may return
          it within 30 days for a full refund or exchange. To be eligible for a
          return, the product must be in its original condition and packaging.
          We reserve the right to refuse a return if the product is not in its
          original condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team, who
          will guide you through the process. Once we receive your returned
          product, we will process your refund or exchange within 5-7 business
          days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that shipping and handling fees are non-refundable, and
          you will be responsible for the cost of shipping the product back to
          us.

        <p>
          If you are not satisfied with our service, please contact us
          immediately, and we will do our best to resolve the issue. If you are
          still not satisfied after our efforts to rectify the problem, we will
          provide a full refund of the service fee paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that refunds are not provided for services that have been
          completed. If you cancel the service before it is completed, we will
          refund the portion of the service fee that has not been earned.

        <h3>Digital Products</h3>

          Due to the nature of digital products, we do not offer refunds on
          digital downloads, including software, e-books, and music. If you
          experience any technical issues with the product, please contact our
          customer service team, who will assist you in resolving the issue.

          Please note that certain products or services may have specific refund
          policies that supersede this general policy. If a product or service
          has a specific refund policy, it will be clearly stated on the product
          or service page.

          In conclusion, we strive to provide our customers with the best
          possible products and services. If you have any questions or concerns
